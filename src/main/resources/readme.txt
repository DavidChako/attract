My working hypothesis is that momentum is rationally quantized,
by which I mean that any particular momentum can be reliably represented
as a discrete number of incrementally discrete aka whole number values.

Momentum also has a geometric aspect,
requiring volume in which to reside,
plus at least four directions of travel outward
in order to project volumetrically.

Four is the minimum number of incrementally discrete variables required
to describe quantized volumetric extent and motion of a center of momentum.

Four incremental rays outward from the center of momentum,
such that no three of the rays are in the same plane,
the simplest such configuration being the four directions outward
from a symmetric tetrahedronâ€™s center through its vertexes.

With respect to attraction per se,
in the absence of any other disturbance,
it makes sense to insist that
if two momenta are in relatively close proximity,
while relatively remote from all other momenta,
and they are merely inter-attracting,
then each of them will be individually conserved,
as will the sum total momentum of the two.

Individual momentum conservation means that
the sum of the components of any given momentum is constant.
This also implies that incremental change in momentum
is the increment of one component occurs iff another is decremented.

Sum total momentum conservation means that
the sum of components for the same direction across the momenta is constant.

When two momenta are thus attracted,
this translates into six constraints on the evolution
of the eight whole number variables across the momentum system of two.
Which leaves two whole number variables necessary to account system state.

Extending to three momenta inter-attracting,
one new constraint is added in the form of the conservation of the added momentum;
and one additional term is added to each of the total momentum component conservation constraints.
Then there are five whole number variables required to account the system state.
